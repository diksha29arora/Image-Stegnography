# Image-Stegnography
As a union of Image Processing and Cyber Security, this program is capable of hiding text inside an image.

In this program, Steg.png is the demo image from which a new image, named encoded.png, will be generated at the execution of Encrypt.py program. This new image will contain the hidden text.
Decrypt.py is another program which is to be executed after Encrypt.py, in order to decode the hidden text on the receiving end.

(I implemented this program during the hands-on session on Computer Vision)
